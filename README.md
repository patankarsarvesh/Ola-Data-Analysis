# Ola-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis on Sample Ola Data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. Includes data cleaning, SQL queries, and Power BI dashboard visualization.

📌 About This Project
Hey there! 👋 This project is all about diving into Ola ride data and uncovering interesting insights using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The goal was to clean the data, analyze key trends, and visualize everything with an interactive dashboard.

🛠 Tools Used
Excel → Cleaned raw data, removed duplicates, and formatted for analysis.

MySQL Workbench → Ran SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

Power BI → Created an interactive dashboard to visualize ride patterns.

📊 How I Analyzed the Data
🔹 Step 1: Data Cleaning in Excel
Removed duplicate entries to ensure accuracy.

Standardized column formats and fixed inconsistencies.

Saved the cleaned file as a CSV for further processing.

🔹 Step 2: SQL Data Analysis
Using MySQL, I ran queries to answer important questions, like:
✔ How many bookings were successfully completed?
✔ What’s the average ride distance for different vehicle types?
✔ Who are the top 5 customers with the most bookings?
✔ How many rides were canceled by customers vs. drivers?
✔ What’s the revenue generated based on payment method?
✔ What are the highest and lowest driver ratings for Prime Sedan rides?
✔ How do customer ratings compare across vehicle types?

(Check out the full Ola_Data_Analysis.sql file for all queries.)

🔹 Step 3: Data Visualization in Power BI
To bring the numbers to life, I built a Power BI dashboard that covers:
📈 Ride Volume Trends → How rides increased/decreased over time.
📊 Booking Status Breakdown → Success vs. cancellations.
🚗 Top 5 Vehicle Types → Ranked by total ride distance.
⭐ Customer vs. Driver Ratings → Who rates better, customers or drivers?
💰 Revenue by Payment Method → Which payment method dominates?
📍 Cancellation Reasons → Why do rides get canceled?
